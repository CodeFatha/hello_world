This is a project primarily focused on helping me learn Java, version control as well as the software development life cycle. In this sprint, I will start off with a python script to write a Hello World program

## Plan
I will take on two challenges from CodeWars, I will write and run the code there and once it passes the test, I will include it here with the challenge description as well as the ranking

## Purpose
To learn how to manage the learning process of a programming language while actively learning on a project
